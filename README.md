# App Using Google Maps - Places API

## Running - Getting Started
Make of copy of the '.env_example' file named '.env'.

'.env' should look like so:
|Variable|Setting|
|---|---|
| GOOGLE_API_ID | [Your Google Maps API Key] |

Then in terminal run the following:
```sh
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# to build the app once
$ npm run build

# to build the app on every change to any file
$npm run build-dev
```
Run index.html in your browser.

## Use
If you want to play around with the app check out the following suggested search queries:
* "peet's"
* "bar"
* "restaurant"

## Tech Stack
* React
* Webpack
* Sass

## Note
The commit history is brief because I started the project with react-app, a new CLI tool for quickly setting up react apps, and then copied the 'src' directory into a new project with a build process made from scratch.
